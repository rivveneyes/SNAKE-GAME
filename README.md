<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This was a challenge to build, constantly working with a grid and managing the snake's movements.
I spend days on problems I would have I enjoyed, the process of each step and that "AH" moment went some thing finally clicked.
In the end it was a 2 week process, along with alot of developer tool practice.</p>
